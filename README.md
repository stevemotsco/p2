##### Project2 created by Steve Motsco and initially posted to GitHub at 1130CDT, 30Sep14

##### Project URL:  http://p2.stevemotsco.me/

##### To get a large selection of words to choose from I used the file "wordsEn.txt" located on the SIL website at: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/

##### Did quite a bit of work from behind a firewall on Thursday, 02Oct14, so I did not push updates to GitHub near as much as I would have liked.  I did regularly save changes during the day in temp files on my local machine (psuedo- version control.) 

##### Without using javascript or jquery, I could not find an elegant way to get the dropdowns to save the selected value.  There is more php code on content.php than I would like.
